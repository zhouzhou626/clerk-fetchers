# FAQs

Before you dive too deep here, you might want to start with our [Contributors' Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and overall [Readme](README.md). If you've read those and still need more answers, 
check out the info here! If you still have questions after that, you can join the [Zulip](https://civictown.zulipchat.com/join/jmprqfsjk63a5fqwkq3kafvr/) to ask or open an [Issue](https://github.com/civicband/clerk-fetchers/issues) on this repository. 

# What's a municipality?
Municipalities are local civic bodies like cities, towns, boroughs, counties,
and public boards (like a School Board, Planning Board, or Port District
Oversight Board).

For Civic Band's purposes, the useful question is whether the body owns the
meeting records you want Clerk to fetch. City councils, county commissions,
school boards, planning or zoning boards, water districts, and similar local
authorities are generally in scope. States, countries, federal agencies, and
broad state/country portals do not count as municipalities unless the site is
only hosting records for a specific local body.

# How can I tell if my municipality uses a supported backend, or if we need a custom scraper?

We have a WIP-draft Chrome extension experiment that should be able to help you tell, but it's not really ready to use yet. For now, navigate to the page that has the actual PDFs of your meeting minutes as best you can and look for the names of the supported scrapers in the URL, around the top of the page, and in the page's meta data when you **View Source**. If that sounds like too much, you can leave a note in the issue that says you're not sure whether it needs a custom scraper or not, and a maintainer will check it out for you.

# Why would I need a custom scraper?

If a page doesn't use a [supported backend](CONTRIBUTING.md#Existing-backends), we'll need to use a custom scraper. If we end up with two or more cities using the same backend that we don't support yet, though, we can add a new reusable scraper for them. Please let us know if you see this, and we'll keep an eye out as well.

# What if my municipality hosts minutes/agendas in multiple places?

Right now, due to technical limitations, we ask that you just pick one primary scraper to use. We have an [open issue](https://github.com/civicband/clerk/issues/6) to fix this in the [Clerk](https://github.com/civicband/clerk/) repository, and it has a [subtask](https://github.com/civicband/clerk/issues/145#issue-4471550967) to update this FAQ when it's fixed.
